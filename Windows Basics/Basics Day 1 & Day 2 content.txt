Server
---------
to monitor, update, upgrade the server we need the interfaces like: 	
	1. HP 		- iLO 	(integrated Lights-Out)
	2. Dell 	- iDrac (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller)
	3. Intel 	- IPMI 	(Intelligent Platform Management Interface)

Server Form Factor
--------------------
- it refers to the size, shape & design of a server.
- factors like:
	- Blade server
	- Rack server
	- Tower server
	
Server events:
---------------
- these are system generated notifications or logs
- these logs helps admins in:
	- monitor
	- troubleshooting
	- maintainence.
- types of server events:
	- Hardware events 	- generated by CPU, RAM, HDD, Power supply
	- Power events 		- unexpected power off, failures
	- thermal events 	- overheating warnings, temperatures
	- boot/POST events 	- events got generated at boot/POST level.
	- OS events 		- OS reboots, kernel panic, service startup or failure.
	- Security events 	- login attempts, breaches
	- Network events	- link up/down, IP conflict, NIC failure
	- storage events	- disk failures
	- IPMI events		- remote access activities, sensor issues.
	
	
POST - Power On Self Test

to check logs in windows:
	1. PowerShell cmdlet
		> Get-EventLog -Logname Application -Newest 5
	2. Event Viewer
	
how to check the performance of your system (client, server)
	GUI -> Performance Monitor
	CLI -> perfmon
	
to check logs in linux
	/var/log/messages
	
Remote management interfaces:
	- iLO
	- iDrac
	- IPMI
	
windows	-> powershell
Linux	-> shell script, powershell

Monitoring tools:
	- Nagios
		- Nagios Core - free of cost, manual work, linux-based
		- Nagios XI   - free for 60 days, automated
	- Splunk
		- paid 
	- Promethus
	- Data dog

Hypervisor
	- is a tool to achieve virtualization
	- it allows you to run multiple OSs in it.
	- HV are of 2 types:
		- Type 1 Hypervisor 
			- Bare-Matel Hypervisor
			- because these HV are installed directly on top of the hardware.
			- they do not require additional OS to run. 
			- because, these HV themselves act as an operating system.
			- examples:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
				- VMWare ESXi
				- Citrix Xen Server
			- usage:
				- Type-1 is used for running application with great performance & efficiency.
				- basically, in production we use Type-1.
			
		- Type 2 Hypervisor 
			- Guest-Based Hypervisor
			- Need an operating system to work, they cannot work WITHOUT OS.
			- examples:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
				- VMWare Work station (paid, free to download)
				- VMWare Player (free)
				- VMWare fusion (MacOS)
				- Linux KVM
				- Oracle Virtual Box
			- usage:
				- useful for home system, medium or small organization.

Storage:
----------
	- Primary storage
		- directly accessible by the CPU
		- its fast, but temporary.
		- like:
			- RAM
			- Cache Memory
				- L1 cache
				- L2 cache
				- L3 cache
	- Secondary storage
		- long-term storage, non-volatile
		- like:
			- HDD - Hard Disk
				- it has movable parts
				- IOPS - 150
			- SSD - Solid State Drive
				- it has no movable parts
				- IOPS - 1.5Million
			- CD/DVD drive
	- Archival Storage:
		- long-term storage solution
		- like:
			- Tape drive
			- cloud archives
	
	- DAS
		- Direct Attached Storage
		- these storages are directly connected to the server/PC.
			- USB, HDD, flash drives
		- in DAS, no network is present.
		
	- NAS
		- Network Attached Storage
		- File-level storage over LAN.
			- NFS (sharing data between win-to-win & linux-to-linux) - Network File Sharing 
			- SMB (shares data over different OS, windows-to-linux)  - Service Message Block
	
	- SAN
		- Storage Area Network
		- high speed storage solution with redundancy
		- this is an enterprise-level solution
			- Fiber-Optics channel, iSCSI or FCoE
			
File System:
--------------
	- file system is a data-sttucture used by OS to 
		- organize
		- store
		- retrieve
		- manage data
	- components of filesystem:	
		- files			- container for the data
		- directory		- logical container for the files/directories
		- inodes		- metadata about file.
		- blocks		- basic unit of storage allocation
	- types of file systems:
		- NTFS			- New Technology File System, windows, latest in windows
		- FAT32			- File Allocation Table, windows & linux
		- EXT4			- Extended 4 file system, linux
		- XFS			- Extended File system, Linux, latest in Linux
		- HFS			- MacOS
	- file systems used in Windows:
		- FAT
		- FAT32
		- ExFAT
		- NTFS
		- ReFS
	- file systems used by Linux:
		- EXT, EXT2, EXT3, EXT4
		- XFS
		- BtrFS
		- CramFS
		- FAT32
