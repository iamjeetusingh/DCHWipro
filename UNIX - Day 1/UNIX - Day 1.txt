UNIX administration:
---------------------
	- its an operating system
	- UNIX - UNiplexed Information and Computing System (UNICS)
	- released in 1st Jan 1970
	- developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
	- in AT & T bell labs
	- in "C" language
	
UNIX operating system
	- AIX (by IBM)
	- HPUX (by HP)
	- Solaris (by oracle)
	- MacOS (by Apple)

concepts:
	- Opensource	-->  Linux
		- it is 
			- free to use
			- free to download (source code)
			- free to share
	- Freeware		-->	UNIX
		- free to use
		- free to share
		- you can not download the source code
		
UNIX
	- is hardware dependent
	
Linux Benedict Torwalds
	- creator of Linux OS
	- 1991
	
Why to choose LINUX ?
- Easy to install applications	-> package manager
- Secure	-> SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux)
- Easy to change options -> Graphical Machines (GUI)
- Community
- Free
- Portable	-> Live ISO
- Open Source
- Multi-User Hierarchical File System (FHS)



Shell 
	- check/validate the command is correct or not.
	- convert the english command into valid binary code and transfer it to kernel
	- types of shells
		- CSH
		- TCSH
		- SH
		- BASH	--> default
		- POSIX
		- Korn Shell (KSH)
	- list of all the installed shells are present in 
		- /etc/shells
		
Linux booting process:
-------------------
Power On   -->   BIOS 
BIOS
	- Basic Input Output System
	- performs POST (Power On Self Test) 

Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR
MBR
	- Master Boot Record
	- holds the address of operating system
	- size: 512 bytes
	
Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR  --> GRUB	
GRUB
	- GRand Unified Bootloader
	- current version: v2.0
	- displays/lists all the operating systems that are present in HDD

Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR  --> GRUB	 --> Kernel
Kernel
	- is the heart of operating system
	- it loads the OS from HDD to RAM using (initrd.img)
	- it loads the other required services

Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR  --> GRUB	 --> Kernel --> systemd
systemd
	- systemd process is initialized 
	- SYSTEMD as 1st process of linux OS.
	- old name: "init"
	- Process ID: 1

Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR  --> GRUB	 --> Kernel --> systemd --> Runlevel
Runlevel
	- its the mode, in which the system must be started
	- there are 7 modes in runlevels
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	      OLD    |  Runlevel Cmds   | Commonly used Cmds
	-----------------------------------------------------------
		- init 0 - runlevel0.target - poweroff.target
		- init 1 - runlevel1.target - rescue.target
		- init 2 - runlevel2.target - multi-user.target
		- init 3 - runlevel3.target - multi-user.target
		- init 4 - runlevel4.target - multi-user.target
		- init 5 - runlevel5.target - graphical.target
		- init 6 - runlevel6.target - reboot.target
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
Power On   -->   BIOS   -->   MBR  --> GRUB	 --> Kernel --> systemd --> Runlevel -> login
login
	- username
	- password

CentOS/RedHat 7/8/9 -> the whole booting process generally take upto 20Sec

users in linux:
	1. root (administrator in windows)
	2. regular users 


File system Hierarchy Standard:
-------------------------------
"/"
	- /boot		- bootable file in it. (min: 350MB)
	- /home 	- home directory for regular users
					-> chaturya		-> /home/chaturya
					-> ganesh		-> /home/ganesh
					-> hulk			-> /home/hulk
	- /root		- home directory for root user
	- /bin  	- contains the binary commands that a "regular user" can execute
	- /sbin 	- contains the binary commands that a "ROOT user" can execute
				- root user can also execute /bin commands
	- /etc  	- contains all the configuration files in it. [IMP]
	- /dev  	- contains all the "device" related files in it.
	- /mnt  	- contains all the temporary mount points, user access this /mnt (old)
					- /mnt/abc
	- /run  	- all the running media (other device)
					- /run/media/abc
	- /tmp  	- temporary files
	- /usr  	- contains all the user installed applications
	- /opt		- contains all the user installed applications (old)
	- /var		- variable length file. It contains the LOG FILES.
	- /lib		- developers library. (32bit)
	- /libx64	- developers library. (64bit)
	- /proc		- it contains all the running processes information in it.
	
create & modification a file:
---------------
	- touch
		- create blank files
		- updates the timestamp (last modified time) of a file
	- cat
		- create
		- view
		- override
		- append
		- concatenate
	- nano	
		- create, modify 
	- gedit
		- create, modify 
	- vim
		- create, modify 
		
Delete file/directory
	- rm	--> deletes a file or directory
	- rmdir	--> deletes the empty directory
	
copy file within a system
	- cp <source>  <destination>
	
copy file from one system to another
	- scp <source>  <destination>

move a file
	- mv <old-file-location>  <new-file-location>
	
rename a file 
	- mv <old-file-name>  <new-file-name>
	
hide a file
	- mv <file-name>  .<file-name>

unhide a file
	- mv .<file-name>  <file-name>

list anything
	- ls			--> list 
	- ls -a			--> list all (hidden & visible)
